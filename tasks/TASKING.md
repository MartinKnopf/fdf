# Tasking Guide

Tasks must be atomic and verifiable.

## Writing good tasks
A good task includes:
- A single clear goal
- Hard constraints + relevant links (docs/ADRs/contracts)
- Explicit acceptance criteria
- Exact validation steps (commands)

## Task lifecycle
- backlog -> active -> done

## Task template
Use templates/task.md.
